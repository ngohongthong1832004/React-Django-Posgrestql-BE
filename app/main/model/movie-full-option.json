        "desc": "In 1244, during a time of religious persecution, Pope Innocent IV and King Louis IX of France sought to eradicate a pacifist Christian group known as Cathars. The last of the Cathar heretics found protection at the Castle of Montsegur. Here a dedicated group of about 100 defending knights, under the Leadership of Lord Raymond and his family, held a crusading army of over 10,000 mercenaries at bay for 9 months. To this day, many people believe that the Cathars were the guardians of a treasure of great significance, possibly even the Holy Grail. It is rumoured that in the last days of the siege a small group managed to slip away in the dead of night to retrieve this hidden treasure and get it safely away from the clutches of the Catholic Church. This is their story.",

Secure in a loving relationship with his partner Mary, Oxley slowly emerges from his solitary torment to join the world we all share.  The film follows him as he tentatively unpicks his confused thoughts and feelings about the past with his brother Peter. From his struggle with the physical effects of years spent self-medicating to his hopeful contemplation of a married future and a daring return to the stage, The Sunnyboy is the definitive documentary of Jeremy Oxley's journey from the Sunnyboys and back.",

Gradually, the promise of \"Not to fall in love\"falls apart, and Toru finally cannot hold back his feelings and confesses his love to Maori. However, Maori confesses to him that she has anterograde amnesia, which causes her to lose her memory in a day.

What is it like to be a human being and spending your whole life trying to express something through sounds? The characters wake up, rehearse, record, perform and talk about music.

They devote themselves to finding a space to create a connection to something bigger than themselves. Something that will outlast all of us.",
